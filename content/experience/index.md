      title: Curriculum Vitae
      text: Since December 2021 I am an Akademischer Rat at the [Institute of Applied Dynamics](https://www.ltd.tf.fau.de) at the  Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.<br>I studied mechanical engineering with focus on mechanics and control theory at ETH Zurich and received my BSc and MSc degrees in 2013 and 2015, respectively. For my PhD, I joined the [Institute for Nonlinear Mechanics](https://www.inm.uni-stuttgart.de) at the University of Stuttgart, where I graduated in 2021 under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Remco I. Leine. Thereafter, I moved to Erlangen, where I have been appointed as Akademischer Rat.

      ## GAMM Juniors

      In 2023 the GAMM elected me as a GAMM Junior. In 2024 the GAMM Junior elected me as their *deputy speaker*. <br>[GAMM Juniors](https://www.gamm-juniors.de) are young researchers and members of the GAMM, who are characterized by an excellent diploma/master and/or PhD thesis in the fields of Applied Mathematics or Mechanics.   
      Currently, I am the deputy speaker of the GAMM Juniors.
