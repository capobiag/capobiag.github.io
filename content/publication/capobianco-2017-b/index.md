abstract: Abstract In this paper, we derive and compare three integrators for nonsmooth
  mechanical systems by discretizing the principle of virtual action with finite elements
  in time. The weak as well as the strong variational form of the principle are discretized
  using a piecewise linear shape function and different quadrature rules. After introducing
  a suitable constitutive law for the contact forces arising in the discretized system,
  this approach leads to the well established time‐stepping scheme of Moreau [1],
  the variational Moreau‐type scheme derived in [3] and another related scheme, which
  we call the symmetric Moreau‐type scheme. It is shown using a benchmark system that
  the symmetric and the variatonal Moreau‐type schemes, in contrast to Moreau's scheme,
  show an excellent longterm energy behavior. (© 2017 Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
