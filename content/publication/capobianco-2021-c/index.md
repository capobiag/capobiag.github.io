abstract: This dissertation deals with the mathematical description and the simulation
  of mechanical systems with frictional contact. First, a geometric theory for the
  description of smooth mechanical systems is developed, which is then extended to
  allow for nonsmooth motions, i.e., motions with discontinuous velocities. The developed
  nonsmooth theory of mechanics is used to describe mechanical systems with frictional
  contact. Finally, two numerical schemes for the simulation of such systems are derived
  by using a time finite element method and the generalized-alpha approach, respectively.
