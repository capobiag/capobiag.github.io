 abstract = {This dissertation deals with the mathematical description and the simulation of mechanical systems with frictional contact. First, a geometric theory for the description of smooth mechanical systems is developed, which is then extended to allow for nonsmooth motions, i.e., motions with discontinuous velocities. The developed nonsmooth theory of mechanics is used to describe mechanical systems with frictional contact. Finally, two numerical schemes for the simulation of such systems are derived by using a time finite element method and the generalized-alpha approach, respectively.},
