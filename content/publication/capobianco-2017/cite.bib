 abstract = {In this paper, we derive and compare three integrators for nonsmooth finite dimensional mechanical systems by discretizing the principle of virtual action with finite elements in time. As shape functions, linear Lagrangian polynomials are used. The different integrators are derived by applying different quadrature rules for the discretization of the strong or the weak variational form of the virtual action. After the discretization, the constitutive laws for the contact forces are introduced, resulting in Moreauâ€™s time-stepping scheme and two other schemes. Several examples are used to compare these integrators in terms of longterm performance.},
