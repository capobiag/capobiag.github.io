abstract: In the theory of second-gradient continua, the internal virtual work functional
  can be considered as a second-order distribution in which the virtual displacements
  take the role of test functions. In its easiest representation, the internal virtual
  work functional is represented as a volume integral over a subset of the three-dimensional
  Euclidean vector space and involves first and second derivatives of the virtual
  displacements. In this paper, we show by an iterative integration by parts procedure
  how an alternative representation of such a functional can be obtained when the
  integration domain is a subset that contains also edges and wedges. Since this procedure
  strongly relies on the divergence theorem for submanifolds of a Euclidean vector
  space, it is a main goal to derive this divergence theorem for submanifolds starting
  from Stokesâ€™ theorem for manifolds. To that end, results from Riemannian geometry
  are gathered and applied to the submanifold case.
