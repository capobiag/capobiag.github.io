abstract: In this article, the existing nonsmooth generalized-ùõº method for the simulation
  of mechanical systems with frictionless contacts, modeled as unilateral constraints,
  is extended to systems with frictional contacts. On that account, we complement
  the unilateral constraints with set-valued Coulomb-type friction laws. Moreover,
  we devise a set of benchmark systems, which can be used to validate numerical schemes
  for mechanical systems with frictional contacts. Finally, this set of benchmarks
  is used to numerically assert the properties striven for during the derivation of
  the presented scheme. Specifically, we show that the presented scheme can reproduce
  the dynamics of the frictional contact adequately and no numerical penetration of
  the contacting bodies arises‚Äîa big issue for most popular time-stepping schemes
  such as the one of Moreau. Moreover, we demonstrate that the presented scheme performs
  well for multibody systems containing flexible parts and that it allows general
  parametrizations such as the use of unit quaternions for the rotation of rigid bodies.
