abstract: To describe time-dependent finite-dimensional mechanical systems, their
  generalized space-time is modeled as a Galilean manifold. On this basis, we present
  a geometric mechanical theory that unifies Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics.
  Moreover, a general definition of force is given, such that the theory is capable
  of treating nonpotential forces acting on a mechanical system. Within this theory,
  we elaborate the interconnections between classical equations known from analytical
  mechanics such as the principle of virtual work, Lagrange’s equations of the second
  kind, Hamilton’s equations, Lagrange’s central equation, Hamel’s generalized central
  equation as well as Hamilton’s principle.
