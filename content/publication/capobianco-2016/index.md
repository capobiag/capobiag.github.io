abstract: 'In this paper we derive a variational integrator for nonsmooth mechanical systems by discretizing the principle of virtual action with ﬁnite elements in time. After the discretization with local ﬁnite elements, the constitutive laws for the contact forces are introduced as in Moreau’s time stepping scheme. This derivation shows exemplary how variational integrators for systems with frictional unilateral constraints can be derived. The long-time energy behavior of the presented scheme is compared with the behavior of Moreau’s stepping scheme on an example system.'
