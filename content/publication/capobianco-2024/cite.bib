 abstract = {This paper introduces a family of Lobatto IIIA-IIIB methods for simulating mechanical systems with frictional contact. These methods extend the existing schemes by addressing both bilateral and unilateral constraints, as well as set-valued Coulomb friction. The Lobatto IIIA-IIIB methods presented in this paper make a substantial contribution to the ongoing endeavor of developing event-capturing versions of high-order schemes.},
