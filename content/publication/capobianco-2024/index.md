abstract: This paper introduces a family of Lobatto IIIA-IIIB methods for simulating
  mechanical systems with frictional contact. These methods extend the existing schemes
  by addressing both bilateral and unilateral constraints, as well as set-valued Coulomb
  friction. The Lobatto IIIA-IIIB methods presented in this paper make a substantial
  contribution to the ongoing endeavor of developing event-capturing versions of high-order
  schemes.
