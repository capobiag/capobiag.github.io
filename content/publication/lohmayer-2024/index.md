abstract: Multibody dynamics simulation plays an important role in various fields,
  including mechanical engineering, robotics, and biomechanics. Setting up computational
  models however becomes increasingly challenging as systems grow in size and complexity.
  Especially the consistent combination of models across different physical domains
  usually demands a lot of attention. This motivates us to study formal languages
  for compositional modeling of multiphysical systems. This article shows how multibody
  systems, or more precisely assemblies of rigid bodies connected by lower kinematic
  pairs, fit into the framework of Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS). This
  approach is based on the hierarchical decomposition of systems into their ultimately
  primitive components, using a simple graphical syntax. Thereby, cognitive load can
  be reduced and communication is facilitated, even with non-experts. Moreover, the
  encapsulation and reuse of subsystems promotes efficient model development and management.
  In contrast to established modeling languages such as Modelica, the primitive components
  of EPHS are not defined by arbitrary equations. Instead, there are four kinds of
  components, each defined by a particular geometric structure with a clear physical
  interpretation. This higher-level approach could make the process of building and
  maintaining large-scale models simpler and also safer.
