abstract: Abstract The language of differential geometry allows a coordinate-free
  representation of physical quantities. This led to the development of several geometric
  theories for the description of finite-dimensional mechanical systems. These approaches
  differ in the mathematical concepts they invoke and in the classes of mechanical
  systems they can describe. This short note aims to give an overview on the following
  three popular approaches, all of which are limited to time-independent mechanical
  systems. While in the first approach, the motion of the mechanical system is considered
  as a curve in the system's configuration manifold, in the latter two, the corresponding
  motions are interpreted as curves in the tangent or the cotangent bundle of the
  configuration manifold.
