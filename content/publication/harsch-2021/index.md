abstract: A new director-based finite element formulation for geometrically exact
  beams is proposed by weak enforcement of the orthonormality constraints of the directors.
  In addition to an improved numerical performance, this formulation enables the development
  of two more beam theories by adding further constraints. Thus, the paper presents
  a complete intrinsic spatial nonlinear theory of three kinematically different beams
  which can undergo large displacements and which can have precurved reference configurations.
  Moreover, the hyperelastic constitutive laws allow for elastic finite strain material
  behavior of the beams. Furthermore, the numerical discretization using concepts
  of isogeometric analysis is highlighted in all clarity. Finally, all presented models
  are numerically validated using exclusive analytical solutions, existing finite
  element formulations, and a complex dynamical real-world example.
