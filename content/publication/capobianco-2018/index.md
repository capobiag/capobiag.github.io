abstract: 'An undeformed pantographic sheet consists of two orthogonal arrays of straight ﬁbers interconnected by internal pins. In this paper, we model the ﬁbers of this lattice-like sheet as nonlinear Euler–Bernoulli beams and use B-spline functions for their ﬁnite element discretization. Using the concept of one-dimensional generalized force laws, we show how different models for the pins can be introduced in the model. Finally, the simulation of a tensile test is presented.'
