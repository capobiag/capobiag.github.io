## Akademischer Rat at [Institute of Applied Dynamics](https://www.ltd.tf.fau.de)
Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg

I am a researcher and lecturer in the field of mechanics. My research is focused on the *dynamics and control of flexible multibody systems with frictional contact*. Hereby, my interests range from the exploration of the *theoretical foundations* and the development of *general methods*,
applicable to a large class of systems, to the design of *tailor-made solutions* for the analysis, simulation and control of specific *real-world systems*.

I am an initiator and enthusiastic developer of the [cardillo](https://github.com/cardilloproject/cardillo) project. A simulation software for mechanical systems with frictional contact.
