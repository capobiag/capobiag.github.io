title: Adaptive dynamic fracture simulation using peridynamics
summary: Peridynamics is a particle-based (mesh-free) discretization method for solid mechanics that is particularly suited for the modelling of fracture. It is the goal of this research to devise expedient numerical methods for dynamic fracture simulation by developing dedicated solvers with temporal and spacial adaptivity.
