title: Simulation of flexible multibody systems with frictional contact
summary: It is the goal of this research to combine the developed event-capturing schemes and beam discretizations with esablished methods from computational multibody dynamics. These effort results in our actively developed a research code that can be used for engineering applications and for educational purposes.
