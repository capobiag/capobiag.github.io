title: Development of event-capturing schemes for mechanical systems with frictional contact
summary: The mechanics of systems involving frictional contact can be effectively described within the framework of nonsmooth mechanics. This theoretical approach permits the velocities of the system to experience sudden jumps due to impacts. The objective of this research is to create specialized numerical algorithms capable of efficiently handling the nonsmooth behavior that is intrinsic to the simulation and optimal control of such systems.
